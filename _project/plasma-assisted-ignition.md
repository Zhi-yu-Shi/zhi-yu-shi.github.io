This research consists of two separate but closely related works. In the first work, we numerically investigates plasma-assisted ignition and flame propagation using nanosecond discharges. It is the first comprehensive analysis of how varying non-equilibrium conditions - such as applied voltages, electrode gap sizes, pulse repetition frequencies, and pulse numbers - impacts ignition in an NH3/H2/air flow using a multi-dimensional approach. The focus is to control non-equilibrium energy transfer for efficient NH3 combustion in reactive flows by strategically manipulating electron energy deposition pathways, modifying energy distribution within the discharge region, and promoting the continuous accumulation of radicals. The following conclusions were found: 

1. An E/N of around 200 Td optimizes ignition enhancement due to the most effective generation of radicals and electronically excited species.

2. Excessively large electrode gaps lead to ignition failure due to reduced energy density. An excessively small gap size constrains the size of the initial ignition kernel.

3. At lower frequencies, the ignition kernel volume decreases due to radicals quenching and heat loss during the inter-pulse period. At higher frequencies, the effect of two sequential pulses merges to resemble a single pulse.

4. A higher pulse frequency combined with more pulses maximizes the overlap region, accelerates radicalsâ€™ accumulation, and significantly enhances ignition performance.

In the second work, we numerically investigates the hybrid plasma (NSD+DC) assisted ignition and flame propagation for H2/air mixtures. We aim to show that hybrid plasma is more efficient than NSD at the same total energy in reactive flows and explain the mechanisms as well as to control non-equilibrium energy transfer for efficient hybrid plasma assisted ignition, focusing on the effects of NSD voltage, DC voltage, pulse repetition frequency. The following conclusions were found:
