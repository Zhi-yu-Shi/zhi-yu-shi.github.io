N2 dissociation is the rate limiting step in the Haber-Bosch process of ammonia synthesis. One effective way to reduce the barrier of N2 dissociation is to use metal nitride instead of metal itself as the catalyst. In this work, we aim to understand the reaction mechanism of nitride formation. Experiments have found that compared to N2 plasmas, nitride formation is more efficient at N2/H2 plasmas, specifically at N2/H2 ratio is 4:1. Besides, NH also reaches its maximum amount at the same mixture composition. We conducted DFT calculations to
1. explain the mechanism of nitride formation on Nickel under N2/H2 plasma environments
2. understand how NH facilitates nitride formation
3. explain why the maximum nitride formation is observed at N2:H2 = 4:1

Our conclusions are:

In N₂ plasmas: nitridation follows direct N adsorption or N₂ adsorption/dissociation.
In N₂/H₂ plasmas: nitridation proceeds via NH adsorption/dissociation.
NH vs. N₂: NH adsorbs more favorably and dissociates with a lower barrier, enabling nearby N&H species that strongly promote N penetration.
Synergy: N–H co-adsorption reduces activation/reaction energies beyond additive effects. 
Competition: Preadsorbed N/H facilitates N penetration but also enhances competing H penetration → controlling H coverage is essential.
