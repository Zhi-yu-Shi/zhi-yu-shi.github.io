  This work numerically studies the plasma assisted deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) of H2/O2 mixtures in a microscale channel with detailed chemistry and transport. The results show that the DDT onset time is non-monotonically dependent on the discharge pulse number. The DDT is accelerated with small pulse numbers, whereas retarded with large ones. Two different DDT regimes, respectively at a small and large plasma discharge number, via acoustic choking of the burned gas and plasma-enhanced reactivity gradient without acoustic choking, are observed.
