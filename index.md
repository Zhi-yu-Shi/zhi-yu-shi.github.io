I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in the department of Mechnical Enginnering at Princeton University, working with Prof. Yiguang Ju.

I study plasma-assisted combustion and chemical synthesis, driven by the broader goal of enabling green manufacturing and a net-zero carbon future. My research centers on how to control non-equilibrium energy transfer to improve energy-conversion efficiency in reactive systems. I seek to bridge the understanding of microscale reaction kinetics with macroscale flow phenomena, both in the gas phase and on catalytic surfaces.

To achieve this, I have developed a multiscale modeling framework that integrates quantum-chemistry calculations (DFT), machine learning molecular dynamics (ML-MD), and large-scale parallel simulations of reactive flows. This framework allows me to connect fundamental reaction mechanisms with real-world plasma and combustion processes. Ultimately, my goal is to provide the scientific foundation and develop accurate, comprehensive modeling tools to enable sustainable, efficient, and controllable energy-conversion technologies.
